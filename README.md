## Gameplay

The Portfolio Adventure is a text-based game where you navigate through different rooms in a virtual house. The goal is to explore, interact with objects, and discover the hidden elements within each room. You control the game by typing commands into the terminal.

## Commands

Here are some commands you can use in the terminal:

- `resume`: Display the resume of the game creator.
- `help`: Show a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `rooms`: List all accessible rooms from the current location.
- `lookAround`: Display the description of the current room.
- `enter <room>`: Move to the specified adjoining room.
- `objects`: List interactable objects in the room (feature coming soon).
- `interact <object>`: Interact with a specific object (feature coming soon).

## RoomMap

The game's structure is defined in the `roomMap.js` file, where each room has its own set of properties, including accessible rooms and a description.

Your exploration awaits! ðŸš€
